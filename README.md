# LRU Cache API

Welcome to the LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache API! This project implements a simple yet efficient LRU caching mechanism with a twist - each cache item comes with an expiration time. Built with Go and the elegant Gin framework, this API provides a high-performance, concurrency-safe cache layer suitable for a wide range of applications, from optimizing backend systems to speeding up web applications.

## Features

- **LRU Eviction Policy**: Ensures the cache only holds the most recently accessed items, automatically evicting the least recently used ones when the cache is full.
- **Expiration Time**: Each key-value pair in the cache can have an expiration time, after which it gets automatically evicted, ensuring fresh data and efficient memory usage.
- **High Performance**: Written in Go and leveraging the Gin framework, this API is designed for speed and efficiency.
- **Concurrency Safe**: Uses Go's concurrency primitives to ensure that the cache is safe to use in a multi-threaded environment.
- **Simple RESTful API**: Provides straightforward GET and SET endpoints for easy interaction with the cache.

## Getting Started

Dive into the world of caching with our LRU Cache API. Follow these steps to get your cache server up and running in no time!

### Prerequisites

Before you embark on this caching adventure, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Go (version 1.14 or later recommended)
- A sense of adventure

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anujaagarwal/LRU_Cache.git
    cd LRU_Cache
    ```

2. **Run the server**

    Fire up your terminal and launch the cache into action:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

    Your LRU Cache API is now listening for cache interactions!

### Usage

Interact with the cache using its RESTful endpoints:

- **Set a key-value pair**

    ```bash
    GET /set?key=<your-key>&value=<your-value>&duration=<expiration-in-seconds>
    ```

    Set your desired key-value pair in the cache, along with an optional expiration duration in seconds.

- **Get a value by key**

    ```bash
    GET /get?key=<your-key>
    ```

    Retrieve the value associated with your specified key. Remember, if the key has expired or doesn't exist, you'll embark on a quest to find nothing.

## Example

Setting a key-value pair with a 60-second expiration:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/set?key=hero&value=batman&duration=60s"
```

Retrieving the value for the key `hero`:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/get?key=hero"
```
